When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are working with a team of programers, which are working on diferent computers. Or when you work on multiple computers or 
locations, and is not convinient or possible to have it on a single computer.

-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with you remote repository?
You can have more control over what is send to the servers, and therefor have control over the caracteristics you want to share and when to share them. Also, 
some modules may require many commits before they are finished, so it may not be convinient to update the remote with eevery commit.

-Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is used when you want to clone a repository that exists on the servers of GitHub on your own repository of GitHub, while clone is when you want to have a copy
of a repository that exists on the GitHub servers, on your own computer. Branch is used when you want or need to have more than one version of the project your 
working on. They can exist either on your own computer or on the GitHub servers.

-What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
The benefit is that you can know which was the last state of the repository, so if you have other updates on GitHub that where done after that last local state, 
you can what to update.

-How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I would collaborate using either e-mail (pasing the files as attachments), using the cloud or directly using a storage device (like an USB). It would be faster if 
the persons I collaborate with are near me, and if we are few. It woudl be harder if it is require to transfer many files and merging them. Also, it would be 
harder to keep track of all the changes.
